I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Computer Science department of Princeton University since April, 2017 and I am part of the Prof. Ben Raphael's research group, which focuses on cancer computational biology, since November, 2015.

My research concerns the development of algorithms and mathematical models to address biological problems that arise from the study of sequencing data in the field of computational biology and cancer computational biology. In particular, my current research focuses on the identification and evolutionary study of Copy-Number Aberrations (CNAs)--which are frequent somatic mutations in cancer that either amplify or delete large genomic segments--starting from both bulk-tumor and single-cell sequencing data.

My background is in Computer Science and my main interests include combinatorial optimization, computational complexity, integer linear programming, and the design of exact and parameterized algorithms, approximations, and heuristics. I received the title of PhD in Computer Science from the University of Milano-Bicocca (Italy) in 2017 under the supervision of Prof. Paola Bonizzono and Prof. Ben Raphael, after being a Visiting Graduate student at Brown University (US) in 2016. One of the goals of my research is to show that formal mathematical formulations for biologically motivated problems and careful analysis of their computational aspects are crucial to obtain meaningful insights.
