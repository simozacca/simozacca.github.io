# Description

CHISEL has been published in *Nature Biotechnology* at: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-020-0661-6.
CHISEL (Copy-number Haplotype Inference in Single-cells using Evolutionary Links) is a method to infer allele- and haplotype-specific copy numbers in single cells and subpopulations of cells by aggregating sparse signal across hundreds or thousands of individual cells.
CHISEL is available on GitHub at https://github.com/raphael-group/chisel.
